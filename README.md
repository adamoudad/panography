# Panography
Small Computer Vision project for image stitching in panography
Python with OpenCV and NumPy.

This code can create a panorama from two images for now.
Next improvement should enable panorama from n images.

# Flow
* Finding Keypoints and Descriptors
* Matching
* Stitching


# Usage
You need to create two directories for the source and output images :
* ./sources/ for the images that will be stitched into a panography
* ./outputs/ for the output panography
